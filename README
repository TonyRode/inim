This document will help you to understand how to use the project.

First of all, the aim of this project is to code a program which recognizes the quarter notes in a given picture as entry of the program, drawing a colored circle around the recognized object.


To use the project, go to the root folder of it, and simply type "make" (be sure to get the version 4.5 of your favorite compiler aka g++)
It will create a binary file, named "detect".

Then, launch it like this :
"./detect path_src_img path_dst_img [accuracy]"

accuracy is optionnal, this is an int that you can specify if you know the dimension of the note.


And see the result in the destination image.


Supported image types are :
    PBM
    PFM
    PGM
    PNM
    PPM
BUT, you must use pbm format for the source image (the command "convert" is very useful under linux).
